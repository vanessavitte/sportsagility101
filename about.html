                <h2>Camp Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>Sports Agility 101 will provide young quarterbacks, receivers, running backs and tight ends with the very best instruction in skill development. We will teach four main values that exemplify the acronym "T.I.E.S": Teamwork, Integrity, Excellence, & Sportsmanship.</p>
				<p>It is important that our young people learn attributes to better serve our community. Under the expert care of our sports camp coaches, kids not only learn individual, sport-oriented skills, but they also develop personally and socially, learning teamwork and building character. We develop life skills through sports.</p>
